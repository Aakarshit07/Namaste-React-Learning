Tilde (~) vs Caret (^) in package.json: What’s the Difference?


    Caret (^) s used to specify a “compatible with most recent” version range. 
    we’re saying that we want to use version 17.0.1 of the react package, 
    and we're willing to accept any version greater than or equal to 17.0.1 
    and less than 18.0.0. This allows us to receive patches, bug fixes,
    and minor version changes, but not major version changes.
    example:
            {
                "dependencies": {
                    "react": "^17.0.1" this version can go like 17.1.1, or 17.3.1 etc.. but not 18.0.0 
                }
            }

    example: 
            {
                "dependencies": {
                    "react": "~17.0.1" this version can go like 17.0.2, or 17.0.3 etc.. but not 17.1.0
                }
            }


Why CDN links are not prefered to used?
CDN link are not the prefred way to bring React and ReactDOM in our Project.
Because CDN has to make network call and then get the data.
also when the version of the React or any other package will update
in future over and over theen we also has to keep chaning the url of our CDN.

SO its better to Install react or anyother package in node modules and 
use it from there and it becomes more effecient.
